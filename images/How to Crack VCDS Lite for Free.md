VCDS Lite is a diagnostic tool for Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda cars that allows you to scan for fault codes, read and clear trouble codes, view live data, and perform basic settings. However, VCDS Lite is not a free software and requires a license to activate all its features. If you don't have a genuine Ross-Tech interface, you may be tempted to look for a crack code generator that can bypass the activation process and unlock VCDS Lite for free.
